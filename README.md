This github repository contains three python files. The file names and short descriptions of each are listed below. 

1. Advection.py

This python file solves the advection equation using the FTCS and Lax-Friedrich methods. The Lax-Friedrich method is stable while the FTCS is unstable.

2. AdvectionDiffusion.py

This python file solves the advection-diffusion equation using the Lax-Friedrich method for the advection and an implicit method for diffusion.

3. HydroSolver.py

This python file solves the continuity and Euler equations for a slight gaussian perturbation in density.
